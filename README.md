# pend_magman_wrappers
Wrappers for an inverted pendulum and magnetic manipulator to be used in the baseline algorithms alongside OpenAI gym environments

Download or clone the wrappers to a folder and install them (probably it would be good to pre-install gym with pip install gym)

Run 
> pip install -e . 
in the gym-tim folder from the terminal.

call it by using 

> import gym_tim
> gym.make('tim_magman-v0')


Pre-requisite libraries for the magman and pendulum can be found here:
